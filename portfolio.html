                So, for my first piece, I used a baby picture of me surrounded by some stuffs that is related to the late 90s and early 2000s. And I kinda have gone overboard by also adding some stuff that isn't related, but it does have a sentimental value to me, so I insist on adding them up to the pile because why not.</p>

              Our theme is about the 2000s or the Y2K era. So, I thought maybe I could try making an art about me literally during the 2000s period. This one is nostalgic to me especially the part that I enjoyed and got addicted playing Tamagotchi way back then and this piece is my version of how I transform those happy childhood memories into an art.</p>

              I have this cat named Luna. She’s a black half persian and half puspin/local breed cat. She has helped me a lot mentally especially most of my dark times ever since I got her. So, I’m really eager to make an art about her. And I made this piece where cats are like some deity or goddess. So, basically this one is my appreciation art piece specially made for her, and I think she deserves to be part of my exhibit artworks :3</p>

              This one was a last-minute idea that I came up with. I think I got inspired doing this type of art because of the songs that I was currently listening to when I was creating my first art pieces. So, this is the result. I know that some arts have a lot of stories, meaning and different interpretation to it. One of this one’s story is me getting better and evolving into a better version of myself which is also a good reminder for me that I am progressing, and I should be proud of myself. So, this one is a pat on my own back for still trying and continuing even if it’s small and slow progress because those small progress lead me up to this version of myself.</p>

                This is my last piece. It’s one of the first ideas I thought of when brainstorming about what type of subject I’ll go with this exhibit and I thought I can easily play around on what I’ll put on in this piece. Until I got stuck and got trouble on deciding what to do next with it. So, I keep pushing this one aside and I almost discontinue it at all because I’m undecisive whether I’ll go full on emotion about it or keep it low and simple. But I guess I end up going the easy and simple route just because the first drafts were a bit too much and kinda difficult to execute especially given that I was running out of time, super busy, and I keep having technical difficulties with my equipment since the first art pieces. The end…</p>
